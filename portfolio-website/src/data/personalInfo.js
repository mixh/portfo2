  // Brief introduction
  bio: "Hello! I'm Mihir, and I like coding and technology. I am a recent grad with a Master's degree in Computer Science at Stevens. This website is a showcase of one such project that I've developed. Additionally, I have a strong inclination towards Java for non-web coding endeavors. I excel in coding and full-stack development. Feel free to explore some of the projects I've undertaken to witness my skills in action. Ready to collaborate or have a project in mind? Feel free to get in touch. Let's work together to bring ideas to life!",
